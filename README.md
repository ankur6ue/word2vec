Implementation of the skipgram model in word2vec. Derived from https://github.com/fanglanting/skip-gram-pytorch
I have added some additional text preprocessing steps and support for using a pre-trained model to initialize the embedding matrices. See http://www.telesens.co/2018/02/08/word2vec-experiments/ for details
